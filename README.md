# toronto-wind-speed-predictions
This project uses a database of fluid dynamics simulation results for the City of Toronto and a weather API to predict real-time, historical, and forecast wind conditions along a drone flight path. The code is written in Matlab and the main application is called windApp.mlapp. The application draws on a database of CSV files which is over 5TB so I have not shared it in this repository. It can be found at the following drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/6/folders/1lhvwuJwRlks-QiVIZxTArjR8LeRnPsE8
